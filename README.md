Kaggle Housing Price Competition

The is an ongoing competition on www.kaggle.com to test your machine learning skills.  The URL for the competition is https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-data-for-ml-course/data.

The purpose of the competition is to develop a model to predict the Sale Price of a house, based on *50* features. 

This public repository will serve as my platform for my project.  This project will be split on four (4) distinct steps and they are as follows:

1. Data Cleaning and Transformation
2. Data Exploration
3. Model Development and Refinement
4. Model Testing

I will be using python as my preferred language, as well as Jupiter Notebook to present my findings.
